Hey Software Catalog Team -

We are loving the new Resources app you created. This is awesome! Thanks for doing this!
(insert more platitudes here)

We have an issue - Some people are tagging resources with the "security" tag.

The security folks would like to be notified any time a resource is added with that tag
so that they can review it.

They are creating an API you can call, and will get back to you when they have that ready.

Here's what they are thinking - 

- If a new post is created that has a tag of "security"
- You send a message to their API with the ID of the post.
- They will send you back an ID of a "review request"
- Please store that in your database.

Later we will have to add a way for them (security folks) to approve those resources,
or remove them.

For now, just display them as "pending security approval" if they are tagged like this.

Cool? No problem? Thanks.

Mgmt.
